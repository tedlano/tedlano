				<h1>A Few Things I've Done Lately...</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>Left my job as a software consultant to pursue some personal interests for a bit</li>
					<li>Moved to Kunming, China for 3 months to focus on learning Mandarin</li>
					<li>Built and will continue building this website to develop my technical skills, and have a creative outlet</li>
				</ul>
				<br/>
				<p>
					I was sitting at work one day, wondering when I would have the time to do the things I've always wanted to do.  Then I realized that nothing was standing in my way, and all I had to do was go do them.  So I did.  I may have left a few opportunities behind, but I also may have opened the doors to many completely new ones.  Who knows, but why not <a href='./articles/OnTakingRisks.html'>take a few chances</a> while you still can?

				This section is for detailing my travel schedule for those who are curious, but mostly for my mother who will worry if she doesn't know where I am.  She's even been looking into getting me a satellite phone, just in case a terrorist cell tracks me down in the wilderness and I need to call for an emergency helicopter evac.  What a nice and caring mother I have.

Ever had fried tofu skins?  Pretty much the same thing.  Or watch me win a dance competition at a friend's wedding.</p>

				You've found my creative space.  I've always wanted to get better at web development and writing, so here's where I've set up shop.  This is mostly a way for me to write down my own thoughts and opinions, and tailor them as if somebody else is reading.  I figured that maybe some of the things that I write down in my personal journal could have some value to a broader audience.  Journalling is one thing, blogging is a whole different beast.  <a href="./articles/suckingAtThings.html">I may be a terrible writer now</a>, but I don't stay terrible at things for long.
			    <br/><br/>
				I just turned 26 and made the decision to leave my job to try something different for a while, just because I can.  I could give a lot of excuses as to why I'm not in peak physical condition, or why I cannot speak Mandarin fluently, or why this website isn't the greatest personal site I've envisioned it to be.  The real reason is that I let my surrounding environment determine my priorities, and I didn't have the discipline or energy to push back.  Now when I wake up, I have free reign over what I'll be doing the entire day.  I could choose to invest that time, or I choose to waste it.  Only thing that can get in the way is my own discipline.
				<br/><br/>
				So here I am.  I've set some priorities in my life and the only person that can stop me is myself.  The purpose of this website is to track my progress, and hold myself accountable to them.  I'll be heading to China in a few days to immerse myself in the language and culture in order to become better-suited as an aspiring international know-it-all.  I don't think I'll have this sort of freedom from responsibility for much longer: no debt, no wife, no kids, no worries what-so-ever.  It will only get more difficult to take risks as we get older, so <a href="./articles/OnTakingRisks.html">there is no better time than right now to take some</a>.  Here's to a new, exiciting chapter of life.  I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I do.

				Sometimes, a person or organization will attempt to persuade you in conceding as much of your valuable time as they can.  They'll say its important, they'll say its required, and they might even say it is in your best interest to do so.  Be very wary of them.  They may not be looking out for your best interests; only you can do that.  If you've made good decisions in the past, and if your instincts have led you to make those good decisions, be careful about ignoring them on the advice of somebody else.  Somebody else stands to gain from your efforts as much as you do, and you have the power to choose how to direct those efforts.  You'll never get what you deserve unless you go get it for yourself.

				So here I am.  I've set some priorities in my life and the only person that can stop me is myself.  The purpose of this website is to track my progress, and hold myself accountable to them.  I'll be heading to China in a few days to immerse myself in the language and culture in order to become better-suited as an aspiring international know-it-all.  The plan is to plan as little as possible.  At the rist of sounding, but its easy to forget that when we're always focused on the next destination.  I don't think I'll have this sort of freedom from responsibility for much longer: no debt, no wife, no kids, no worries what-so-ever.  It will only get more difficult to take risks as we get older, so there is no better time than right now to take some.  Here's to a new, exiciting chapter of life.  I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I do.

				 Here, there are very little boundaries to what I can do; which is actually more of a challenge than an opportunity.  There are many things that I've wanted to get better at, which includes: programming, writing, design, organization, and finding a creative outlet.  The hard part is finding the right balance between them all in order to produce something that works.  I could spend months and months designing a cool site without writing a single blog entry.  I could throw together a site full of content with a sloppy code base, making it harder and harder to maintain.  The challenge here is finding a pragmatic approach that includes a little bit of everything.
				<br/><br/>
				That not only true for website-building, but also for everyday life.  There are a lot of competing forces out there that will throw off the ideal balance that we're all trying so hard to acheive.  I think we all have experienced this at one point or another: the demands of your job may triumph over your physical or mental well-being, your relationship with your significant other might take precendence over your larger social groups, or a night of partying prevents you from attending that early-morning yoga class you love. All of these little concessions we make will oftentimes accumulate and lead to bigger consequences at large.  All of the things you've been meaning to do, and all of the things you've been meaning to learn about have fallen off-schedule.  Suddenly, you're not the person you hoped you would be and you're not making enough progress towards becoming them.  Wouldn't it be nice if you had a few months of complete freedom?  If you had three months to focus on yourself, what would you go do?
