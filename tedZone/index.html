				<h1>Welcome to the TedZone</h1>
				<p>
					Here's where I'll keep my personal things.  You may find them interesting, or self-serving, or poorly written; which is why I named it the TedZone.  Since this is my own little universe, I can make up an infinite amount of excuses and justifications for anything I write.  You're free to explore my little universe at your own leisure.

				<h1>Reading List</h1>
				<p>If you're in the mood to learn or wish to look into some self-help books, here's a few that I really enjoyed.  Also FYI, I'm using a pretty nifty table widget here that allows you to filter search and sort on columns.  Programmers would appreciate that, everybody else probably doesn't notice it.</p>

				<h1>Cool Internet Resources</h1>
				<p>Here are some of my favorite internet resources, especially because I feel productive when visiting them opposed to everything else on the internet.  I am honestly ashamed of all the time I waste on other internet sites, but funny pictures of cats aren't going to laugh at themselves.</p>
				<table id="internet_site_list" class="display table_border" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>Educational Videos</td>
							<td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Kurzgesagt" target="_blank">Kurzgesagt Youtube Channel</a></td>
							<td>My favorite Youtube Channel by far.  Their animations are crisp and simplistic, and the narratives are clear and effective.  Burn a few minutes here and learn a thing or two about interesting things.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Educational Videos</td>
							<td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse/playlists" target="_blank">CrashCourse Youtube Channel</a></td>
							<td>Another great educational channel on Youtube.  The videos are a bit longer, but they cram an amazing amount of information into them.  Well produced, well researched, and well executed..</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Blog</td>
							<td><a href="http://markmanson.net/" target="_blank">Mark Manson Blog</a></td>
							<td>I'm actually afraid to link this because now it looks like I'm trying to rip this guy off, which is sort of true because I wish I were more like him.  His blogs are well-written, well-informed, and incredibly interesting.  He also has accomplishments to back up his words, whereas I am mostly just pontificating.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Blog</td>
							<td><a href="http://blogmaverick.com/" target="_blank">Mark Cuban Blog</a></td>
							<td>I learned more about Mark Cuban by watching the TV show "Shark Tank".  I bought his ebook, which is really a collection of some of his blog entries, and read through it during a flight.  What's not to love about a super sucessful entrepreneur who follows their instincts?</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Educational</td>
							<td><a href="http://memrise.com/" target="_blank">Memrise.com</a></td>
							<td>This is my favorite language-learning resource.  I currently use it to study Mandarin and Tagalog, but have also used it for different subjects in the past.  I have even created my own courses: <a href="http://www.memrise.com/course/351640/the-seven-chakras/">The Seven Chakras</a> and <a href="http://www.memrise.com/course/362545/internet-mandarin/">Internet Mandarin</a>.</td>
