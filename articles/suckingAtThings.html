			<h1>Off to a Lousy Start?  You Should Be.</h1>
			<p><i>
				My message here is to go out and do things without worrying about getting it right, because we always start off being terrible.  Before Michael Jackson learned how to dance, he probably sucked at dancing.

				I have no idea how to write a blog entry, especially ones where I’m attempting to get some sort of message across.  I don’t know whether to address the audience indirectly, reference us as part of a whole, or to just talk directly to you.  I know there are linguistic terms to explain those, but I don’t know those either.  I also tend to stray from the point, filling in little details that have nothing to do with the message I’m trying to get across.  I’m also worried about coming off as pretentious or arrogant; after all, what makes me an expert on any of these topics?  I feel like I am not qualified to write a blog, or qualified to give advice.  I’m especially concerned because most of my sentences start with “I”, and I remember that my third grade teacher told me not to do that.  Something as simple as writing a blog entry is actually quite intimidating.
				<br/><br/>
				It’s safe to say that I’m not an experienced writer; but there was also a time where I wasn’t an experienced programmer.  Once upon a time, I didn’t think I would ever be qualified to write a single line of code for a respectable organization.  I felt like I didn’t know enough, and I never knew if I was doing it the “right” way.  I didn’t even major in Computer Sciences, so I thought that I would be leagues behind everybody else.  Little did I know, I would end up leading development teams for some of the largest organizations in the world.  In a few short months, my programming knowledge grew faster than I could ever have imagined.
				<br/><br/>
				Did I somehow learn all of the “right” ways to do something?  Not at all.  I learned that there are thousands of ways to solve the same problem, and everybody had their own way of doing it.  It suddenly became my job to write code, so I did it the best that I could.  I tried things, and if they didn’t work, I tried again.  I took online courses on programming concepts, but the real learning lessons came through actual, hands-on work.  I was responsible for delivering pieces of functional code, and moving on to others.  Over time, through trial and error, experience, and Google; I would find more elegant ways to structure and write code.  I was tempted to go back to my older pieces of work to rewrite and revise them, but I didn’t have the time to do so.
				<br/><br/>
				I could go on and on about programming practices, but I’m determined to stay on task.  I’ll link another article on this topic later on.  The point is, there’s always a better way of doing something, and you can’t expect yourself to get there unless you do all of the wrong things first.  This quote from the cartoon, "Adventure Time" sums it up nicely:

				One of the most valuable resources I had was a mentor who let me make my own mistakes.  I would ask him for his thoughts on problems, but it was ultimately up to me to muck my way to a solution.  Bad ideas are very similar to good ideas, but distinguishing between the two requires real-world experience.  If my mentor had solved those problems for me, I wouldn’t have gotten the opportunity to go through a critical thinking process that ultimately improved my overall problem-solving ability.
				<br /><br />
				Having that was important, but I believe that the most important factor was that there was an expectation that I complete a certain amount of work within a given timeframe.  I didn’t have time to worry about all of the little details, nor did I have time to figure out the most optimal or efficient method, nor did I have time to sit back and hope that somebody else figured it out.  If it's going to get done, I needed to get moving.  This time constraint forced me to prioritize and tackle the big items and let the smaller items fall into place, only addressing them if they became real problems.  Most of the time, the smaller things didn’t end up making a difference.  The only thing I had to do was just go out and do it.  Nike has one hell of a slogan.

				Every once in a while, you'll get a fortune cookie that actually says something helpful.  One of my favorites was this:
				<br/><br/>
			</p>
				<div class="text-center"><i>"A goal is a dream with a plan and a deadline"</i></div>
				<br/><br/>
			<p>
				Whoever writes those little messages found a true gem in that one.  Without a plan and a deadline, your goals will feel like never-ending quests where you'll have the rest of your life to work towards.  It's like waking up on weekends.  If you have nowhere immediate to go, you'll be more inclined to snooze for another hour.  How many times have I hit the snooze button on my own hopes and dreams?  Every new year most of us dream up resolutions and we’re overly-optimistic on our abilities to stick to them.  With a deadline in place, and a plan of action, we are much more likely to actively work towards and complete our goals.  
				<br/><br/>
				My goal today was to finish this blog entry.  As I was typing, I wanted to expand upon more and more ideas to cover every area related to this subject.  Today, I am committed to keeping things brief, so I will end it here.  Morale of the story is: if you plan correctly and give yourself a deadline, you'll be surprised at how fast you can go from being terrible at something to being pretty good.  I hope the same goes for blog writing.
				<br /><br />

				But thats not all; most of us need a little encouragement here and there.  Its the same reason why a personal trainer is oftentimes more effective than trying to do it yourself.  I've been putting off finishing this blog entry because (1) I don't think anybody is going to read it anytime soon, and (2) There's really nothing for me to gain by completing it.  When you work on something for a job you're accountable to the people who depend on you to do your work, and you're looking forward to that nice paycheck at the end of the month.  Who is there to reinforce your commitment to your own personal goals?  Only you, and lets face it, you're probably terrible at keeping yourself honest and committed.  Remember that Netflix marathon you had last week, or the pint of ice cream you ate, or the $100 you spent at the bar?
				<br/><br/>
				At first, I thought the obvious answer was to tell people your goals.  According to this <a href='http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_keep_your_goals_to_yourself?language=en'>Ted Talk</a> you should probably do this in a certain way.
