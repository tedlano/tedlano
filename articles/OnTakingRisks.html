			<h1>No Time Like the Present</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Making a big decision can be frightening, but it really all comes down to a couple of simple questions.  Ask yourself these questions, write them down, evaluate their impacts, and you'll find it a lot easier to decide what is best for you.</i>

				After quitting my job, the most common questions I received were: Why did you quit?  Were you unhappy with your job?  Where are you going to go work next?   Whenever I’m asked these questions, I feel the need to give an extensive answer to hopefully convey that I haven’t become some free-lovin’ hippy that disapproves of general society.  I do occasionally fear the possible disapproval and negative assumptions from others, but for the most part, the reception has been very positive.  To answer the questions: I felt I could make better use of my time, not really, and I don’t know. 
				<br/><br/>
				Leaving the security of a job is frightening.  Every so often I would get bogged down by self-doubt and worrisome thoughts about a bleak future for myself.  I had a well-paying job with some great perks to it.  I got the opportunity to travel internationally for work, learn about technology and business practices, and work on multidisciplinary and multicultural teams.  It’s exactly what I set out to do when I graduated from college.  I didn’t hate my job, I actually liked most of it.  Did I make a mistake?  Why did I leave?  The answer is actually pretty simple.  There isn’t some master plan I came up with, only a few short questions:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>What do I have to lose / What is the worst that could happen?</li>
				<li>Is the timing right?</li>
				<li>What will I regret NOT doing a few years from now?</li>
			</ol>

			<br/>
			<h4>What do I have to lose / What is the worst that could happen?</h4>
			<p>
				This is a question that was posed in the book “The Four Hour Workweek” by Tim Ferris.  Ferris invites you to start writing out each and everything that could possibly go wrong when making a big decision.  After writing it all out, take a look at the various things you’ve written down, and start evaluating their legitimacy.  Here’s my list after removing the extremely silly ones:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<b>A break in work history may look like a weakness to future employers</b><br/>
					I’m confident that I will be able to put a positive spin on it, turning it into a strength.  If they still think it’s a weakness, would I really want to work for them in the first place?
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>I may not be able to find a more-rewarding job right away</b><br/>
					I've saved up enough money to cover myself for a while, I don’t think I’ll ever reach a point where I’ll need to worry.  In the unlikely event where I burn through my budget, my backup plan is to go back to the same job I had before, which is very attainable.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>The next job I get might be a step down from where I was</b><br/>
					True, but it could also be a step up.  That's the whole point.  I'm not guaranteed to move up, I have to work at finding something meaningful and rewarding.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>I may become lethargic and lose ambition by not staying occupied</b><br/>
					I spend a lot of my free time studying, I don’t think I have to worry about staying occupied.  Plus, I was losing ambition at my current job due to the nature of the work.  I definitely had to make some sort of change.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>My goals and interests may change significantly during an extensive absence from work</b><br/>
					This actually seems like a good thing.  Work can act like a barrier to change; a consistent pattern of day-to-day activities that keep me thinking and doing the same things.  There’s nothing wrong with exploring where else my instincts and interests may take me.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<br/>

			<h4>Is the timing right?</h4>
			<p>
				This question is a trap.  I made a lot of justifications to myself while I was deciding on making a change: better to wait until the apartment lease ends; better to wait until I get that promotion; better wait until I reach the 3-year mark at the company; better wait until the perfect opportunity comes along.  There comes a point where you can no longer wait and watch the time go by.  The best time to take risks is when you don’t have much to lose, and generally, you have more and more to lose as you get older; especially when it comes to time.  Here is my super-detailed and comprehensive study on this matter:
			</p>

			</div>
			
			<p>
				The amazing findings from these Nobel-prize worthy studies leave out a couple of things, but the general idea is there.  Life as a young bachelor is easy: I have no wife or kids to provide for or look after, no old parents to take care of, and all the time in the world to recover from any bad decisions.  I am also in good health, and have a lot of energy.  Every passing day brings me closer to when all of that will come to an end, and once it does, I won’t be able to do some of the things that I am free to do today.  Reminds me of a nice quote: "The best time to plant a tree was 10 years ago, the second best time is today."  There really is no time like the present.
			</p>
			<br/>
			
			<h4>What will I regret NOT doing a few years from now?</h4>
			<p>
				I’ve been on autopilot for the last 26 years.  I consider myself one of the most fortunate people in the world to receive the opportunities I’ve been given, but I can’t help but wonder where I would be today if I wasn’t born to an affluent family in the wealthiest country in the world.  I went to public school as a kid, and after grade school I went to college, and after college I got a job at a giant corporation.  The system works: it converted a silly child into a productive member of society, but it feels like I’ve been going down the path of least resistance my entire life.  I have everything I could possibly ask for, but looking back on my life a few years from now, am I going to be content with the fact that I’ve taken such a safe, direct, and processed route to “success”?  I could spend the rest of my life working my way up the corporate ladder, taking my 15 – 20 days of vacation a year, keeping up with silly bureaucratic paperwork and training seminars, hearing the same terrible office banter every week, and eventually retiring at the age of holy-crap-I'm-old, but where's the fun and excitement in that?
				<br/><br/>
				I hear a lot of smug older people smugly state that “youth is wasted on the young.”  I think the general meaning behind that phrase is that young people have all the energy to do awesome things, but they do not have enough free time or money to do them.  They’re too busy saving up for retirement, so that they too can be old and smug, and eventually start talking about how youth is wasted on the young.  I have to imagine that most old folks who say that have a couple of regrets about the past, wishing they did more of what they wanted and took more chances.  
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h4>In summary...</h4>
			<p>
				I oftentimes let my imagination run wild, fretting over every little possibility.  Once I write things down, they become more clear, I don’t think about them as much, and I’m able to evaluate and organize them a lot better.  After looking at each and every one of them closely, they become a lot less frightening.  I encourage you to also write down the things that bother you, break them down in to smaller pieces, and evaluate them one by one.  Not only will you feel better about addressing your worries, but you’ll give your brain bit more processing power by releasing the things you were previously fretting over.
				<br/><br/>
				Are you looking to make a change "sometime"?  The clock is already ticking.
