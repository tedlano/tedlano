				<h1>Chinese Tourists in America</h1>
				<p>
					Here are a couple of cultural differences that a Chinese person might experience if they decide to go and visit The United States.    The purpose of this article is to help avoid troublesome and embarassing situations, as well as inform on the strange things one might encounter.  I apologize in advance if anything here can be construed as offensive.  My only intention here is to inform and provide insight.

				<h1>The Unofficial Rules of USA Tourism</h1>
				<ol>
					<h4><li>Queue Up! <span class='chinese'>排队</span> !</h4>
						<img src="./img/queue.jpg" height="200" width="250" align="right"/>
						If there's a line or queue: get to the end, stand in it, and follow the person ahead of you until it is your turn.  Most of us try and take turns; whether it be for using a crowded restroom, waiting for an open table at a restaurant, waiting to purchase items at the next available register, or buying movie tickets.  Sometimes there is no distinct line, like when you're waiting for a subway train and people gather around the platforms.  Best thing to do here is to not push past other people in order to get to the front.  If its obvious that they're looking to board the same train, and they arrived first, don't try and get in front of them.  When in doubt, gesture the other person to go first and say "after you".  If they respond with "no, after you" then go, nobody wants to be in an continual "after you" standoff.  If somebody does "budge" (i.e. push ahead of other people), most people will give them a dirty look and hate them forever.  Seriously, if the devil appeared on the train suddenly and asked everybody to choose one person to sacrifice to a firey pit, the "budging" person would be first to go.
					</li>

					<h4><li>Keep Pathways Clear</h4>
						<img src="./img/trainExit.png" height="200" width="250" align="right"/>
						This is especially important with public transportation.  When your train arrives, be sure to let all of the passengers off before attempting to get on.  Give them a clear path to leave the train, and only until all passengers wishing to get off have done so, then you may get on.  This is actually the one of the biggest complaints people have about Chinese tourists (and almost exclusively Chinese tourists).  Many of them attempt to get onto trains before letting other passengers off.  Don't perpetuate this stereotype!  Similarly, do not block the path of moving people.  Do not stand in the middle of a sidewalk to take a picture, do not walk shoulder to shoulder with more than 1 person on a busy sidewalk (everybody does this, regardless of nationality), do not stop at the end of escalators.  Always be aware that there may be somebody behind you trying to get somewhere, and you might be blocking their way.
					</li>

					<h4><li>Eating at Restaurants</h4>
						Typically, many restaurants will have a host(m) or hostess(f) up front who is in charge of looking after any reservations and let you know when an open table is ready for you.  If you haven't already made a reservation in advance, tell them how many people will be dining and they'll either seat you and your party immediately, or let you know an estimated wait time.  If there is a wait, you may ask to be put on the waiting list.  This is nice since they keep the line / queue on paper, let you know when its your turn to sit down, and sometimes they'll give you the little thing to the right that goes crazy when its your turn to be seated.  When its your turn, you'll be shown to an open table by the host / hostess and provided with a menu.  Your server will come by shortly and almost always start you off by asking what you'd like to drink.  Glasses of tap water are free, and its completely fine to only get water.  When they come back with your drinks, they'll ask if you want to have any appetizers, or if you're ready to order the main course.  Throughout your meal, they'll come back to check on you every so often to refill water, or ask if you want anything else.  Your server is there to make sure you have everything you need, which brings us to the next item...

					<h4><li>Tipping / Gratuity</h4>
						<img src="./img/receipt.jpg" height="200" width="250" align="right"/>
						This is my least favorite part about American culture.  At sit-down restaurants, you are expected to add an additional percentage to your final bill.  This is known as "gratuity" or "tipping".  Basically, this is how your server makes their money.  If they provide good service, you're expected to leave them a good tip.  A "good" tip is anywhere between 15%-20%, and a bad tip is anything lower than that.  If the server is especially exceptional, I'll leave anything from 25%-30%.  For larger groups, sometimes the restaurant will automatically add a gratuity charge to your bill, so make sure to look over your bill before signing off.  First, pay your bill normally.  When the server comes back with your receipt or change, that is when you add your tip and then leave.  The server normally won't know what you tipped them until after you leave.
						<br/><br/>
						Tipping may also happen in other situations.  Taxi cab rides, drinks at a bar, guy who loads your luggage onto a cart and wheels it to your room, etc.  In some instances, like at coffee shops, you'll see a tip jar next to a cash register.  Personally, I don't think that its really necessary to tip the person who poured my coffee into a glass, but most people will just throw in their loose change, or a dollar depending on what they bought.  <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g191-s606/United-States:Tipping.And.Etiquette.html" target="_blank">Here's a website</a> that goes into more detail about the intricacies of tipping.

					<h4><li>People On the Street</h4>
						It's rare for people to try to engage you in converation while walking down the street.  Not to say to some people aren't just friendly people looking to chat or ask directions to somewhere, but most people are looking to get something from you.  There are essentially three types of people that you may run into:
						<ol>
							<li>
								<b>Mixtape Guy</b> - He'll ask you to listen to some music of his.  If you listen, he'll ask you to either buy his mixtape, or he'll give it to you for "free" and then ask for a donation.  The music is never that great, and definitely not worth buying.  I would suggest that you just walk past these guys and decline listening to their music.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Religious Folk Looking for New Recruits</b> - You may encounter people who ask you for "A minute to listen to the word of God".  Those are the good ones, since they are asking politely.  Other ones might have some pretty hateful and strongly worded signs with them.  If you're not looking to talk religion, politely decline the nice ones, and stay the hell away from the crazy ones.  General rule: If they have a large sign and a megaphone, they're probably crazy.
							<li>
								<img src="./img/survey.png" height="200" width="200" align="right"/>
								<b>Guy/Girl with Clipboard</b> - These people are either trying to get you to sign a petition, conducting a boring survey, or trying to convince you into donating to their organization.  Some of these people are fine: just trying to raise awareness for an issue they care about.  Some of them are real jackasses with good intentions, but are trying to pressure you into doing something you probably don't want to do.  If I have the time and I'm interested in their cause I'll stop and chat for a bit to find out more, but I will never donate or sign up for anything on the spot.  That is what they are trying to get you to do, and are sometimes really annoying about it.  To their credit, they have a better chance of getting donations in a face-to-face conversation, but I try not to let them use that to their advantage.  If I really cared about what they did, I would look them up online later and find a way to help.  They'll try to make you feel bad about not giving $30 to poor children in Africa, but just remember that they're just using that as an emotional appeal to make you feel guilty.  If you really care about their cause, you can go online anytime and research their organization before making any commitments.  
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Person who needs gas money / bus fare / a bite to eat</b> - Some people will approach you and try to appeal to your emotional side, saying that they need just a couple of dollars for gas / bus fare / etc.  "Excuse me sir, I'm just trying to get home but I ran out of gas and I need a couple of dollars to fill up my tank..."  In my experience, the majority of these people are just looking for money to spend on something completely unrelated.  Sometimes I will tell them that I'll walk to the bus stop or gas station to purchase what they want, and almost every time they will decline.  Unfortunately, a lot of people are just looking for money to score drugs or alcohol.  There is a chance that they actually are looking for gas / bus fare, but its a slim chance.  In general, I never give people on the street any cash.  I'll buy them a slice of pizza, or a bottle of water, but I won't just hand over cash that could be spent anywhere.  Easiest thing to do here is say that you don't have any cash on you and walk away, but if you feel compelled to help, I don't suggest giving them any money.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Got any space change?</b> - Again, you never know what they'll spend your money on.  In a city with a large homeless population, I will usually carry snacks around with me and give them those.  That, or buy them some cheap food off of the street.  Last thing you want to do is fuel their drug or alcohol addiction.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>

					<h4><li>Rules for Crossing the Street</h4>
						Jaywalking: The act of crossing a street outside of a designated crossing zone or "crosswalk".  In China, people jaywalk all of the time, even on large and busy roads.  This is less common in the United States.  If the road is small and not busy, its generally okay to cross the street anywhere.  If the road is busy, only cross at designated crossing zones when signaled to do so.  Americans tend to drive in their designated lane, so don't expect anybody to drive around you if you decide to cross whenever you feel like it.  They'll probably sound their horn (which means "You're an idiot" in America), and angrily should swear words at you.
					</li>

					<h4><li>Saying "Thank You"</h4>
						Everybody in China says that I say "Thank You" too often.  This is probably true because I say it all of the time, but it is a normal thing for me.  Whenever somebody does something for my benefit, no matter how small it is, I will thank them.  A server refills my water?  "Thank you very much."  A stranger holds the door open for me?  "Thanks."  Hell, I even thank the bus driver when I get off at my stop.  I probably do say "Thank You" too much, but its better to say it too often than not enough.  Keep this in mind throughout your day in the USA.
					</li>

					<h4><li>Finding a Restroom</h4>
						First off, if you have small children do not let them pee or poop in the streets.  Only dogs get to poop on the streets in America, and even then the owner is required to pick up their poop and dispose of it into a plastic bag.  The hard part about this is that there are very few public restrooms around.  If you're just walking down the street and you suddenly need to use the restroom, you have a few options: 
						<br/>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Politely ask a shop attendant.  Usually if you don't look like a homeless person, they will let you use their restroom.  However, some shop attendants will stick to the "restrooms are for customers only policy".  This means that they'll want you to buy something for their restroom priviledges.  Find a Starbucks, order a tall green tea, and use their restroom guilt-free!
							</li>
							<li>
								Find a large hotel.  They have the best restrooms, and the staff isn't going to know whether you're a guest or not.  Usually their restrooms are very clean and fancy.  You'll swear that you've died and went to heaven.
							</li>
							<li>
								Gas station convenience stores are basically public restrooms.  They are usually open 24 hours a day, and it is expected that they have a working toilet for people stopping in.
							</li>
							<li>
								If you're near a large public park, they'll likely have some public restrooms nearby.  These usually aren't the cleanest places to do your business, but they get the job done.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>

					<h4><li>Songs You Should Probably Know</h4>
						There are certain songs out there that everybody knows the words.  If you are in a crowded bar, and everybody is at least a little drunk, chances are they will start singing along if any of the songs below come on.  By no means are you required to sing, but you get major bonus points if you do.
						<br/><br/>
						<ul>
							<li>"Sweet Caroline" by Neil Diamond</li>
							<li>"Ring of Fire" by Johnny Cash</li>
							<li>"Don't Stop Believin'" by Journey (The greatest bar-closing song of all time)</li>
							<li>"The Pianoman" by Billy Joel</li>
							<li>"Respect" by Aretha Franklin (really just the "R-E-S-P-E-C-T, find out what it means to me..." part)</li>
						</ul>
