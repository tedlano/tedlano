				<h1>Future Technologies Coming Soon</h1>
				<p>
					A young person like me will never be able to fathom just how quickly technology has advanced in my short lifetime.  I was born right when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank">internet</a> came into existence, so I have no idea how the world operated for so long without it.  At the same time, I got to witness the evolution of the commercial internet and personal computers (somewhat) up close.  I was typing MS-DOS commands at the age of 3, spending several hours on AOL Instant Messenger during grade school, using Google and other search engines to find tremendous amounts of resources on any particular subject during high school and college (I actually remember using an encyclopedia to do a report on Polio in middle school), and building enterprise web applications after graduation.  I pretty much rode the wave of the internet without truly appreciating how different and game-changing the technology is.  These days, most of us have a computer that fits it our pockets, constantly connected to the rest of the world.  Our simple minds should explode every time we are reminded of that fact.
					<br/><br/>
					The internet has spawned many new waves: new technologies that are made possible by its existence.  The book "How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World", refers to this phenomenon as "<a href="https://medium.com/how-we-got-to-now/the-hummingbird-effect-c3112b723408" target="_blank">the hummingbird effect</a>".  These new, not-yet matured technologies will completely change the world again and again and again, and we're all fortunate enough to be a part of it.  Will we live more comfortable lives?  Will we take on world poverty and inequality?  Will we advance into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale" target="_blank">Type II civilization</a>?  Maybe, but what are the unintended consequences?  How does one stay secure and certain if the world changes over and over again?  What happens to the jobs that get replaced by these innovations?  What if these new technologies widen the poverty gap?  What if these technologies are used as tools of oppression? *Puts on tin foil hat*
					<br/><br/>
					Below are some technologies that I find most interesting and promising.  I'll attempt to look at the pro's and con's of each of them to hopefully gain a better understanding of the possible impacts they may have.  In addition, I'll list out some follow-on technologies that could become a reality due to the "hummingbird effect".

					<h4><li>Autonomous (Self-Driving) Vehicles</h4>
						<img src="./img/squat.jpg" height="200" width="250" align="right"/>
						<p>
							This is one that we are already starting to see come to life.  Right now they are a bit of a novelty still in the testing and adoption phases, but I think we all imagine that they will be common-place in a couple of years.  Let's focus on the awesome parts of this technology first:
							<br/><br/>
							<b>Pros:</b>
							<br/>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<b>Safety</b> - Humans cannot be trusted to be 100% focused, 100% of time time; especially when we're all trying to get to different destinations and competing in the same arena for space.  Think of all of the overly-agressive, inattentive, distracted, or incompetent drivers you've come across in your lifetime.  Odds are, you've probably done something stupid yourself at one point.  We are too distracted to be trusted behind the wheel, but computers will do exactly as they are programmed.  Remove the human element, and you get rid of the most dangerous component of the vehicle.  Drunk and impaired driving becomes a thing of the past.  With enough proximity sensors, the car will be able to sense more than a human ever could.  On top of that, they will be able to communicate with other vehicles to broadcast their positions, speed, and intentions.  The entire collection of vehicles can be monitored, and optimal behaviors may be calculated and exectuted.
								</li>
								<br/>
								<li>
									<b>Efficiency</b> - The idea that vehicles will communicate with other another will have a tremendous impact on traffic flow.  Since vehicles can broadcast their intentions and positions, other vehicles can plan around them.  Don't you hate it when you're behind a line of cars at a stop light, the light turns green, but it takes a while for you to get going?  The first car goes first, delay, then the second car, delay, then the third...  Autonomous vehicles would be smart and precise enough to all go at the exact same time the moment the light turns green.  That is, if we still have a need for stoplights at all.  <a href="https://youtu.be/4p0DsVPkyZg?t=1m50s" target="_blank">Even this would be possible</a> with autonomous vehicles.
								</li>
								<br/>
								<li>
									<b>Resource Reduction</b> - Think of all of the space we use just to park our cars.  Sometimes a parking lot takes up more real estate than the actual store itself.  An autonomous car could drop you off at your destination, and then go park itself in some off-site spot where space is abundant.  Even better, perhaps none of us will own our own cars anymore.  Once the car drops us off, it will go and pick up another passenger like any normal taxi driver.  There would be less cars on the road, and less spaces needed for parking.  We can use that extra space to develop other things we find important, or another million Starbucks shops.
								</li>
								<br/>
								<li>
									<b>Convenience</b> - Summon a car via an app, and it will get to you in a matter of seconds.  Car is dirty?  It will drive itself to a cleaning station.  Something is broken?  It will drive itself to a repair shop.  Needs charging?  It will drive itself to the nearest power station.  We will not have to deal with the upkeep of our vehicles any longer.  Well, somebody will, but no more sitting in the autoshop waiting room drinking bad coffee and reading really old, greasy magazines.  Though one carwash I used to go to had a jackass parrot that squaked swear words at you, which I will miss dearly.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<br/>
							<b>Cons:</b>
							<br/><br/>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<b>Jobs</b> - As with any new technology, one of the main concerns is that it will replace many existing jobs and trade unskilled labor positions for skilled ones.  Just how many people drive cars for a living?  You've got taxi drivers, bus drivers, delivery drivers, truck drivers, trash collectors, and several more that I can't think of.  If I'm feeling ambitious, I'll do a calculation on this later.  What about other jobs that are based around people driving?  If we move towards a ride-sharing model, we will certainly have less jobs for the support-people.  Traffic cops, car salesmen, parking lot attendants, tow truck drivers, mechanics, and auto-supply store workers will have a tougher time finding work.  I could go on forever here.  Skilled labor positions in various engineering disciplines will be necessary, but where do the rest of the people go?
								</li>
								<br/>
								<li>
									<b>Backlash</b> - People love their cars.  Something about being in control of a sophisticated piece of machinery, feeling the acceleration at the push of a pedal, and zooming past the scenery is extremely captivating.  Auto maintenance is a hobby to many people.  Vintage car shows attract thousands of spectators every year.  Racing is one of the world's most popular sports.  Imagine the backlash that would occur if we suddenly gave that all up in favor of safety?  Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors and one of the pioneers in this new age of automobiles acknowledges the possibility that <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/18/elon-musk-self-driving-cars_n_6891368.html'>it may eventually become illegal for people to drive their own cars</a>.  Will this happen anytime soon?  Probably not.  There are still a lot of old cars out on the road that will last for many more years, but the question will be asked.
								</li>
								<br/>
								<li>
									<b>Nefarious Hacking</b> - This may or may not end up being an actual problem, but the public perception of it will be extremely influential.  What if somebody could remotely control your car, lock your doors, and drive it to wherever they wanted you to go?  Anti-virus software for personal computers is an enormous industry, and yet viruses still infect our computers.  How will automobile security be addressed?  A single bug or exploitation in the software could have disastrous impacts.  Think about the liability that goes along with that as well.  What will happen if somebody dies due to a defect in the vehicle's software, through no fault of their own?  How will the public react to autonomous vehicles when, by definition, they have no control over how they operate?  What if somebody can program a death mobile that drives around equipped with automatic weapons that annihilates all living things?  You may think that sounds silly, but then again, there are some pretty messed up individuals that are sharing the same planet and era with us all.  I'm actually pretty good at pumping up sensationalized scare-tactics.  I should consider a career in network journalism.  Ooo and I guess I'm edgy too, people love that.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<br/>
							<b>Follow-on Tech:</b>
							<br/><br/>
								Okay, so now cars and trucks can go on autopilot.  What's next?  If we can give our heavy machinery eyes and a brain, will we need anybody to operate them anymore?  Upload a landscaping plan to a team of bulldozers and land movers, turn them loose, and watch as a patch of land is cleared away and prepared entirely by machines.  Watch as farm machinery harvest, process, and deliver their food without any middle-men humans in the mix.  Imagine walking through a hospital where the beds and chairs are moving patients around on their own.  What if we put wheels and eyes on a garbage can?  It senses when it becomes full, wheels away down the street to a nearby collection point, empties itself, and returns to its rightful place.  What if our world becomes more eerily like the WALL-E spaceship, or that weird machine in the movie "Casper"?  I think my head will explode if I even start talking about flying drones with eyes and a brain, but <a href="FILL THIS IN LATER, TED, YOU IDIOT" target="_blank">here's a cool video</a>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<br/>
					<h4><li>3D Printing: Plastics, Metals, Electronics, and Human Organs</h4>
						<img src="./img/squat.jpg" height="200" width="250" align="right"/>
						<p>
							These are starting to make the transition from personal hobby to industrial manufacturing and construction tool.  Machining custom parts is an extremely expensive process, but 3D printing them is just as expensive as 3D printing most anything else.  We're not just talking about small parts either.

Traffic cops, car salesmen, parking lot attendants, tow truck drivers, mechanics, and auto-supply store workers will have a tougher time finding work.  I could go on forever here.  Skilled labor positions in various engineering disciplines will be necessary, but where do the rest of the people go?

									<b>Backlash</b> - People love their cars.  Something about being in control of a sophisticated piece of machinery, feeling the acceleration at the push of a pedal, and zooming past the scenery is extremely captivating.  Auto maintenance is a hobby to many people.  Vintage car shows attract thousands of spectators every year.  Racing is one of the world's most popular sports.  Imagine the backlash that would occur if we suddenly gave that all up in favor of safety?  Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors and one of the pioneers in this new age of automobiles acknowledges the possibility that <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/18/elon-musk-self-driving-cars_n_6891368.html'>it may eventually become illegal for people to drive their own cars</a>.  Will this happen anytime soon?  Probably not.  There are still a lot of old cars out on the road that will last for many more years, but the question will be asked.

									<b>Nefarious Hacking</b> - This may or may not end up being an actual problem, but the public perception of it will be extremely influential.  What if somebody could remotely control your car, lock your doors, and drive it to wherever they wanted you to go?  Anti-virus software for personal computers is an enormous industry, and yet viruses still infect our computers.  How will automobile security be addressed?  A single bug or exploitation in the software could have disastrous impacts.  Think about the liability that goes along with that as well.  What will happen if somebody dies due to a defect in the vehicle's software, through no fault of their own?  How will the public react to autonomous vehicles when, by definition, they have no control over how they operate?  What if somebody can program a death mobile that drives around equipped with automatic weapons that annihilates all living things?  You may think that sounds silly, but then again, there are some pretty messed up individuals that are sharing the same planet and era with us all.  I'm actually pretty good at pumping up sensationalized scare-tactics.  I should consider a career in network journalism.  Ooo and I guess I'm edgy too, people love that.

								Okay, so now cars and trucks can go on autopilot.  What's next?  If we can give our heavy machinery eyes and a brain, will we need anybody to operate them anymore?  Upload a landscaping plan to a team of bulldozers and land movers, turn them loose, and watch as a patch of land is cleared away and prepared entirely by machines.  Watch as farm machinery harvest, process, and deliver their food without any middle-men humans in the mix.  Imagine walking through a hospital where the beds and chairs are moving patients around on their own.  What if we put wheels and eyes on a garbage can?  It senses when it becomes full, wheels away down the street to a nearby collection point, empties itself, and returns to its rightful place.  What if our world becomes more eerily like the WALL-E spaceship, or that weird machine in the movie "Casper"?  I think my head will explode if I even start talking about flying drones with eyes and a brain, but <a href="FILL THIS IN LATER, TED, YOU IDIOT" target="_blank">here's a cool video</a>
