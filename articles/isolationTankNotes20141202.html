			<h1>Isolation Tank Notes 2014-12-02</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Here are some notes I wrote down after an isolation tank session back in 2014.  Reading through them again, I'm not sure if I completely agree with some of the things that I wrote, but I didn't want to change them.  It's a record of how I was feeling at that point in time, and my views will certainly evolve and change with time.</i>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Our bodies are the means in which we project our minds onto our surrounding environment.  We can touch things, move things, and communicate things to others.
				</li>
				<li>
					Likewise, our bodies are also the means in which the surrounding environment projects itself onto our minds
				</li>
				<li>
					We perceive our surroundings through our senses
				</li>
				<li>
					In a way, our thoughts and actions are completely determined and formed by our surrounding environment
				</li>
				<li>
					The inner voice in our head is evidence.  More often than not, we have an inner voice in our head speaking to us, in our native language, which directs and guides our thoughts and actions
				</li>
				<li>
					This inner voice was developed through the examination and experience of our surrounding environment
				</li>
				<li>
					Not just our language is a result of our surroundings, but also our thought patterns, our habits, our perception of right/wrong and how we perceive reality
				</li>
				<li>
					We perceive reality through our own experiences and through what other people / entities / advertisements tell us
				</li>
				<li>
					This forms our ego.  Our ego is the channel in which we project our inner selves onto the outside world
				</li>
				<li>
					It is important to actively choose how you surround yourself, because your surroundings will change the way you think and act.  It's sort of like the "you are what you eat" phrase, but a little different: "you become what you experience".
				</li>
				<li>
					How have my surroundings affected my own personal development?  Are there beliefs, habits, or patterns that have been driven into me for the benefit of something or somebody else?  There's certainly some of that, its what the whole marketing and advertising industries thrive on.
				</li>
				<li>
					How about the way a company might influence how their employees act and respond?  A company may push their culture onto their employees until the employee's thoughts and patterns are formed in the company's desired image.
				</li>

				<br/><br/>

				<li>
					I think we all tend to think of ourselves as good, wholesome people on the inside.  Sometimes what we do on the outside is surprising to us, because sometimes it is in conflict with the way we perceive ourselves.  This is when we feel ashamed.
				</li>
				<li>
					We can get wrapped up in how others perceive us... but in the grand scheme of things, this is both the most insignificant part of our existence, and also the only thing we leave behind once we die.
				</li>
				<li>
					What about the subconscious?  What about the responses which are "coded" into our DNA?  What is more powerful, the nature or the nurture aspects of our inner selves?
				</li>
				<li>
					Or it is not that cut and dry.  Neither triumphs over the other, or its a constant yin-yang relationship.
				</li>

				<br/><br/>

				<li>
					We are a super colony, not unlike ants or bees
				</li>
				<li>
					On an individual level most of us are not all that important or critical, but as a collection we can accomplish some pretty amazing things
				</li>
				<li>
					Does an ant worry about how successful another ant is?
				</li>
				<li>
					Does a bee get bored?  Is a bee always trying to find a way to occupy its time?
				</li>
				<li>
					What the hell does a cat do all day when it sits around in the sun and smiles?  What is it thinking about?
				</li>
				<li>
					Do any of these organisms plan ahead, or are they constantly living in the present moment?
				</li>

				<br/><br/>

				<li>
					We live in a world where we are led to believe that the rules are established and exist for a well-defined reason
				</li>
				<li>
					We tend to follow by example, but just how correct or ideal are the people we follow?  Is most of it just a show, when really nobody truly knows the correct answers?
				</li>
				<li>
					The work clothes that I am wearing are impractical.  They stain easily, they wrinkle, they are not all that durable, I have to close my damn shirt by buttoning 7 buttons, I have to put little plastic things in the collar so that it looks straight
				</li>
				<li>
					My work clothes just look are certain way that was deemed "acceptable" by old people.
				</li>
				<li>
					Why has society accepted that as the norm?  How are fashion standards set and accepted by the general populace?
				</li>
				<li>
					More importantly, why are we compelled to follow rules which seemingly have no practical or inherent worth?  How much of our well-being is dependent upon the way some close-minded, conservative, straight-laced individuals perceive us?
				</li>

				<br/><br/>

				<li>
					How does one reach their "full potential"?
				</li>
				<li>
 					The question infers that a person has to work hard, make sacrifices, and achieve tangible results in order to "become" their "full potential" self.  One has to "reach" for it.
 				</li>
 				<li>
					"Full potential" is a moving target.  There will never be a point where somebody says "I've achieved everything that I could have possibly achieved".  By nature we are unsatisfied with where we currently are, because there is always something better out there.  More intriguing, novel, daring, taboo, pleasurable.
				</li>
				<li>
					The only thing we can do is find joy in fulfillment in the things that we choose to do.
				</li>
				<li>
					More often than not, we choose to do each and every one of these things.  Very rarely are you forced to so something that you don't want to do.  There can be threats of punishment, but there is usually a guise that you will gain something from your decision.  Its the classic "if I put in lots of hard work and effort now, I will be rewarded in the future"
				</li>
				<li>
					What is that future reward?  A greater feeling of well-being?  What is stopping us from achieving that feeling in the present?  If we always deny gratification until the future, will the gratification ever come?
				</li>
			</ul>
