			<h1>Letter to Chinese Family</h1>
			<p><i>
				This is the letter I wrote for my application to the <a href='http://homestaychina.org'>Homestay China</a> Program.  I did not do the translations myself, I went on <a href="http://fiverr.com">fiverr.com</a> and had somebody do them for me.

				Greetings Homestay Family,
				<br/>
				<span class='chinese'>寄宿家庭您好，</span>
				<br/><br/>
				I am very grateful and excited that you have accepted me into your home.  I am looking forward to helping you all practice English, and get familiarized with American culture.  I am especially looking forward to the opposite: to practice Chinese and get familiarized with Chinese culture.
				<br/><br/>
				<span class='chinese'>您接受我进入您的家庭，我非常感激和兴奋。我期望帮助你们练习英语、熟悉美国文化。我非常期望我也能够练习中文、熟悉中国文化。</span>
				<br/><br/>
				I am currently 25 years old.  My mother and father are both Americans, but my mother has Chinese ancestry.  That makes my 28-year-old brother and I half-Chinese.  My brother and I grew up in the United States in the northern state of Minnesota, and attended schools which were predominantly upper middle-class caucasian families.  We never had many opportunities to learn about Chinese culture.
				<br/><br/>
				<span class='chinese'>我现年25岁。我的父母都是美国人，但是我的母亲有中国血统。这使得我和我28岁的哥哥都是半个中国人。我的哥哥和我在美国北部的明尼苏达州长大，并在主要是上层中产阶级白人家庭的学校上学。我们从来没有多少学习中国文化的机会。</span>
				<br/><br/>
				My mother is very fond of travelling, so every year we would travel to Hawaii to meet my grandfather (公公), who lived in Hong Kong.  He was a very kind man, and he taught me a lot about Chinese culture.  After he passed away, my mother took my brother and I to Hong Kong to meet some of my grandfather's friends.  I was about 13 years old at the time.  This was the first time I visited Hong Kong and I was amazed at how big and busy everything was.  It also occurred to me that the other half of my ancestry, my Chinese half, was very different than my other half.  All of my grandfather's friends were very generous and happy to see us, even though it was difficult to communicate.  What I found most interesting is that they treated us as if we were their own family members.
				<br/><br/>
				<span class='chinese'>我的母亲很喜欢旅游，所以，我们每年都会去夏威夷见我的住在香港的“公公”。他是一个非常善良的人，并教会我很多关于中国文化的知识。在他去世以后，我的妈妈带着我的哥哥和我回到香港，会见我公公的一些朋友。我那时13岁。那是我第一次来到香港，我惊讶于香港是如此之大、如此繁忙的城市。而且，我的中国血统与我的另一半血统有很大不同。我公公的所有朋友见到我们都非常高兴和宽厚，即使我们之间很难交流。我还发现最有趣的就是，他们对待我们，就像我们是他们的家庭成员一样。</span>
				<br/><br/>
				Seven years later in 2010, I studied at the University of Hong Kong for a semester.  I visited our Chinese family-friends again and they were just as welcoming as before.  I had the opportunity to explore Hong Kong and observe the daily lives of its many citizens.  I also got the chance to see several other cities: Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Siem Reap.  This is when I told myself that I will establish a career that will bring me back to these places for the long-term.
				<br/><br/>
				<span class='chinese'>七年以后的2010年，我在香港大学学习一个学期。我再次拜访了我们的中国家庭的朋友，他们像以前那样欢迎我们。我有机会去探索香港并观察那里市民的日常生活。我也曾有机会去参观其他几个城市：曼谷、吉隆坡、河内、胡志明市和暹粒。就在那时，我告诉自己，我要建立一个让自己在这些地方长期生活的事业。</span>
				<br/><br/>
				In May of 2012, I graduated from the University of Wisconsin - Madison with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and a certificate in Computer Sciences.  For the last 2 and a half years, I have worked with IBM as a consultant for our business process management software.  I had the opportunity to work in Kuala Lumpur for 8 months, leading an international team of developers.  In that time, I learned a lot about Malaysian culture and traveled around the area: Hong Kong, Bangkok, Singapore, Bali, Ho Chi Minh City, and Chiang Mai.
				<br/><br/>
				<span class='chinese'>2012年5月，我在威斯康辛大学麦迪逊分校获得机械工程学士学位和计算机科学证书。在过去的两年半时间里，我在IBM担任企业流程管理软件的顾问。我有机会在吉隆坡工作8个月，带领一个国际开发商团队。在那段时间里，我学习了很多马来西亚文化，也去附近很多地方旅行：香港、曼谷、新加坡、巴厘岛、胡志明市和清迈。</span>
				<br/><br/>
				I've decided that I would like to spend the next few months committed to the things that I find interesting and rewarding.  A few of these activities include studying Mandarin, practicing Martial Arts, learning more about computer programming, mountain biking, practicing yoga, rock climbing, and meditation.  My aim is to become more disciplined, more open-minded, and more focused on personal growth.  One of my dreams is to become a great communicator and to bridge language and culture divides. In order to do so, I must learn more about the various social norms and nuances of a global audience.  I see a lot of promise and potential in China and the rest of Southeast Asia from a business and political prospective, which is why I am planning on living in Asia for at least the next 3 years.
				<br/><br/>
				<span class='chinese'>我已经决定，我要把未来几个月放在我觉得有趣和值得的事情上。这些活动包括：学习普通话、练习武术，学习更多有关电脑编程方面的知识、山地自行车运动，练习瑜伽、攀岩和冥想。我的目标是要变得更加自律，思想更加开明，而且更加注重个人成长。我的梦想之一就是成为一个伟大的传播者，消除文化和语言间的分歧。为了做到这一点，我必须在全球听众的各种社会行为模式和细微差别方面了解更多。我看到中国和其他东南亚国家在商业和政治预期方面的很多承诺和潜力，那就是为何我计划未来三年在亚洲居住的原因。</span>
				<br/><br/>
				I am very excited to be starting this new chapter of my life in Kunming with you.  I am confident that you all will find this experience as valuable as I will, and I will make sure that you are all satisfied with the home stay program.  Please feel free to reach out to me at any time for any questions or requests that you may have of me.  I look forward to meeting you all very soon.
				<br/><br/>
				<span class='chinese'>很高兴能与您在昆明开启我人生的新篇章。我相信，你们会发现这段阅历将是宝贵的，就像我的这段阅历一样，我会确保你们会满意这个寄宿家庭计划。如果您对我有任何疑问或要求，可以随时与我联系。我期望尽快与你们见面。</span>
				<br/><br/>

				Sincerely,
				<br/>
				<span class='chinese'>谨上</span>
