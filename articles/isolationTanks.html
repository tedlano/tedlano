			<h1>Sensory Deprivation Tanks</h1>

				<i>An interesting tool you can use to clear the gunk out of your brain.</i>

				There’s an interesting concept gaining popularity around the United States, known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_tank" target="_blank">isolation, sensory deprivation, or float tanks</a>.  They are pods filled with water, large enough for you to completely lie down in; like a giant bathtub.  The water is about one foot deep (thats 30.5 cm in SI), contains hundreds of pounds (thats about half-hundreds of kilograms in SI) of dissolved Epsom salts, and is kept at an approximate temperature comparable to your skin.  The pod also contains a lid on it which may be opened or closed.

			</div>

			<p>
				When stepping into the tank and laying down, you will effortlessly float on top of the water due to the salt content.  Once the water settles, you’ll barely feel it due to the comfortable temperature.  Close the lid, and you’ll no longer see anything due to the absence of light.  Your ears will sink below the surface of the water, blocking out any sounds from the surrounding environment.  At this point, you’ve essentially shut yourself off from any sensory input from your surrounding environment, leaving you alone with only your thoughts.  You might as well be a brain in a glass jar, just floating in space, thinking.  Up until you pass gas, then you'll definitely get some sensory input.
				<br/><br/>
				A standard float session lasts for an hour.  At first, you’ll start to realize that the thoughts inside of your head are extremely numerous and disorganized.  Your ideas, worries, concerns, desires, and obligations will fight for your conscious attention.  You’re a busy person with many things to do, and they all manifest themselves seemingly at once when you free yourself from external distractions like your smartphone or television.  The problem, or really the benefit, is that you are in no position to take action on any of those thoughts while inside of a sensory deprivation tank.  Your objective here is to let go of those external thoughts, and allow yourself to experience your present self.
				<br/><br/>
				We’ve all had days where we’ve felt sluggish and out-of-step.  Sometimes I’m unable to think of the correct word I want to use in a conversation, or I cannot perform a simple calculation, or I’ve been stuck on the same page of a book for the last five minutes because I couldn’t retain what I was reading.  Think of your mental clarity as a glass jar full of muddy water.  Shake the jar up and everything becomes murky and opaque.  Allow the water to settle, and it suddenly becomes clear.  All of those specks of dirt are the various thoughts you have floating about in your head, which makes it difficult to focus on other things.  Don’t worry or feel anxious when this happens, this is all part of the reason why you’re inside of a float tank.  Now, you need to take some steps in order to alleviate some of those thoughts.
				<br/><br/>
				Experienced meditators are good at this.  One book I would recommend if you are interested in practicing meditation is “Mindfulness in Plain English” by Bhante Henepola Gunaratana.  If you're not looking to read an entire book, <a href="http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/555364ddeab8eac64ffda37c-1200-1078/bi_graphics_meditation.png" target="_blank">here's a nice infographic I found online</a>.  The idea is to focus on your breath.  Inhale slowly to the count of ten (or whichever number you're most comfortable with), pause, and exhale slowly to the same count.  Continue to do this over and over and over.  Eventually, you’ll stop counting and think about something else.  It will take you a while to recognize that you’re no longer counting your breath, but once you do, you’ve successfully practiced mindfulness.  You’ve consciously acknowledged that you became distracted by an intrusive thought.  Think a bit about that thought you had.  What was it?  What made you think about it?  Is this thought troubling, productive, or stressful?  What can you do about it at this very moment?  The good thing is, there’s nothing you can do about it right now.  The only option you have is to let it go, at least until your hour-long session ends.  You can do that, right?  This hour belongs to you and the present moment, external worries can wait.
				<br/><br/>
				Sometimes it helps to imagine the thought visually.  Imagine yourself sitting by a peaceful, flowing creek.  Your thought is a leaf, flowing in the wind, capturing your attention.  Imagine that leaf falling into the creek, and watch it flow down with the current, further and further down the creek.  Eventually, that leaf leaves your field of view, out of sight and out of mind.  Return to your breathing exercise, repeating this process as necessary.

				You may get to a point where you’ve cleared out the nonproductive worries out of your head.  Instead of letting go of every thought, you may want to ride one of them out.  See where it takes you, but try and stay focused on one particular topic at a time.  If your thoughts start to become disorganized, try going back to the breathing technique.
				<br/><br/>
				At the end of your session, you may feel a sense of euphoria.  It is hard to describe exactly what this feeling is.  The world around you just seems a bit more interesting.  Maybe you’ll hear a bird in a tree calling to another, nowhere to be seen, but yet the bird still chirps looking for its friend.  Ever wonder if you’ve seen that exact same bird before?  Maybe you’ll walk by a tree and think about how it’s been consistently swaying in the wind for many years on end, waving at all of the people passing by.  Maybe you’ll pass by a stranger carrying a bouquet of flowers, and you’ll start to wonder who those flowers are for, and what the occasion is.  Maybe you’ll consciously register the slight breeze on your face, or the warmth of the sun’s rays, or the pressure of the ground on your feet.
				<br/><br/>
				The feeling of living in the present moment is a very powerful, yet relaxing feeling.  It’s as if you’re a lot closer with everybody and everything around you, just living on the same rock revolving around the same star, orbiting around the same galaxy.  Your little problems will seem a bit more insignificant, or even completely trivial on the grand scheme of things.
				<br/><br/>
				I highly recommend that you go in for a float session, normally theres a large discount on your first float.  They are a powerful tool that help guide you through some very introspective thinking, which can be extremely restorative.  Everybody I’ve recommended them to have seemed to find an inherent value in them as well and have gone on to do additional sessions.  Think of it as going on a date with yourself.  If you're really looking to get into it, here's a snippet from my favorite TV show that might give you some things to think about:
