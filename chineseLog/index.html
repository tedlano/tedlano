				<h1>Chinese Log</h1>
				<p>
					I'm currently in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunming">Kunming, China</a> living with a local family.  Learning Mandarin has always been one of my goals, so I made it my primary goal for the next 3 months.  While I'm here, I expect to come across many unfamiliar things.  Here is where I'll keep track of some of them, and try to provide some perspective.

					<h4><li>Extremely Clean Living Space</h4>
						<table class="no_border">
							<tr>

									The family keeps an extremely clean, and extremely well-decorated apartment.  Taking your shoes off at the door and putting on indoor sandals is easy enough, but I just stumbled upon a real problem with having pristine floors.  Before I tell you, don't be all high and mighty and pretend that you never do this.  Sometimes, you gotta do what you gotta do.  It's known as the "Pick and Flick" technique.  You feel an itch on the inside of your nose, you scratch it, and a loose, dry bogey comes out with it.  Too far away from the trash can, no tissues in sight, what do you do?  Don't tell me you've never pulled a good ol' "Pick and Flick" back in the day.  I have to remove this technique from my arsenal, because these spotless floors will expose my dastardly deed in a heartbeat.  Life is hard.  I've also started to put socks on my hands while I do pushups, because I kept leaving handprints on the floors.  Makes me feel like one of those pampered dogs that wears shoes on their paws.

					<h4><li>The Squatty Potty</h4>
						<table class="no_border">
							<tr>
								<td>
									I haven't yet mastered the Asian squat, so using the bathroom can be stressful.  First of all, you squat down, but you're not exactly sure if you've positioned yourself over the hole.  What if you miss?!  It's like playing one of those claw machine games, but the prize at the end is not ruining your day.  Secondly, you're unsure whether or not your pants around your ankles are in the line of fire.  Am I supposed to completely take off my pants?  No, definitely not, then I would need to take off my shoes.  The only option is to put your weight into your heels, which just causes another problem.  It's only a matter of time before I lose my balance and tumble backwards into the pile of turds.  Oh, and the biggest thing here is to plan ahead and bring your own toilet paper.  Unless you want to reuse the ones in the small trashcan nearby...NO NO NO NO.  I also don't understand if old people are able to do this just as well.  Can they squat like their younger selves?  What if you had a leg injury?

					<h4><li>Some Interesting Munchies</h4>
						<table>
							<tr>
								<td>
									Taking a look at the living room coffee table (does it count as a coffee table if they don't drink coffee?), I saw a bowl of small little seed-like things.  Can you tell what kind of seeds those are?  You can?  You pothead, those are marijuana seeds!  That's radical and all, but what are they doing on the coffee table?  They are actually a delicious little snack.  Stoners will cry if they knew the amount of seeds I've eaten, thus preventing them from becoming plants.  I thought this was pretty weird, but then I was shown a bag of poppies that are used for when somebody has a cold.  *cough* *cough* Oh my, I may be coming down with something.

					<h4><li>Cigarette Culture</h4>
						<table>
							<tr>
								<td>
									I try to keep track of the important phrases I use on a day-to-day basis and memorize them for when the situation arises.  One of the phrases I've written down is "Xie4 xie5 ni3, wo3 bu4 hui4 chou1 yan1", meaning "Thank You, I do not smoke".  Smoking is very common and open over here, and expect to see people smoking inside of restaurants.  If somebody in your party fancies a smoke, they will always offer you a cigarette as well (If you're a man, that is).  I have to imagine that quitting smoking is incredibly difficult to do, since refusing an offer like that makes many Chinese folks uncomfortable.  It's not just restaurants either, its basically everywhere.  The most surprising to me were inside of a nice shopping mall, inside of a small elevator, and the locker room of the gym I go to.  I wonder how the e-cigarette market will hit China...I doubt the dangers of smoking are not communicated as frequently as they are in the United States.  That, and the Chinese are less direct and will not ask you to stop smoking if you're being a jackass.  This could also be more of a regional thing, as the Yunnan Province produces a lot of tobacco.

					<h4><li>Letting It Rip</h4>
						I guess its sort of immature that I still think that farts are funny.  Then again, if you don't think that they are then you're probably stuck-up.  To my dismay, people here like to play the ol' butt trumpet for everyone else to hear...and its not funny to them.  It's just normal.  Sometimes I hear a really good one, like a professional trombone player giving the best solo of their lives, and I want to laugh and high-five the musician.  But no, everyone here is so humble about their musical talents.  The inner child in me still laughs, but I cannot share that joy with anybody else.  Next time you let one go, make sure you have a laugh for me.  
					</li>

					<h4><li>Oh God, What's that Smell?</h4>
						Speaking of stinky things, this one is torture on the nose.  Walk down a busy street past some food carts and you're bound to smell something incredibly foul.  If I threw onions into my gym bag full of sweaty clothes and left it out in the sun for a day, I think we'd get close to the aroma of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stinky_tofu'>stinky tofu</a>.  Its actually called stinky tofu, so why does anybody eat it instead of, say, normal tofu?  It doesn't have much of a taste, and you have to expose yourself to biological warfare in order to get it.  Imagine having to get slapped in the face with a dirty diaper everytime you wanted to eat a stalk of celery.  Would you keep eating celery?  Perfect for people like me though, who like to pretend they're macho and unaffected by unpleasant things.
					</li>

					<h4><li>Toddlers Mooning Me</h4>
						This will sound slightly pedophilic, but I've seen my fair share of toddler asses while walking around.  Their pants have a hole in the back where their butts are, and they aren't wearing any underwear.  I assume this is during their potty-training phases, and they don't have to deal with all of the problems with squatty potties that I've mentioned above.  Those lucky ducks, I'm jealous that I don't afford the same convenience.  Maybe I can invest in one of those onesies that has a flap where the ass is.  I know, a full 3-piece suit with an ass flap on the trousers.  Style and convenience all wrapped into one.
					</li>

					<h4><li>Status Symbols</h4>
						Aside from nice cars, watches, rings, and clothes; one of the more peculiar status symbols for some Chinese men is a longer fingernail on their pinky.  Their pinky nail is even longer than most women will keep theirs.  I've heard 2 explanations for this.  First one is that having a pinky finger that reaches past the top knuckle on your ring finger is a sign of good luck.  That means, many men try and cheat the good luck system by growing their pinky nail longer.  This explanation makes little sense, but it gets a pass since its based off of superstition in the first place.  The second explanation is that it indicates a person does not need to perform a lot of manual labor, so having a long fingernail is in no way prohibitive to their daily activities.  I fail to see many practical benefits to having a long pinky nail.  I could pick my nose and ears better, skewer a hotdog with it, as well as have a nice spot to snort cocaine from if I ever got the opportunity.  However, I would also have to deal with typing awkwardly on a keyboard, constantly knicking myself, and yet another possible bathroom-related problem.  Maybe this is technique to freak out westerners when giving handshakes, thus gaining the upper hand.  I'll give this one a shot, see what all of the fuss is about.
					</li>

					<h4><li>Traffic Laws are like the Pirate's Code</h4>
						Meaning, they are more like guidelines than anything else.  A red light suggests you stop, but go ahead if you feel like it.  You can also go the wrong way down the street if you feel like it is faster.  You know what?  Forget the street.  Take the sidewalk if you want, nobody is going to tell you not to.  The same applies to pedestrians.  Jaywalking across a busy street is totally fine, so is walking in the middle of the road.  I'm surprised that I haven't seen an accident yet.
